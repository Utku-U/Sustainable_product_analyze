# Sutainable_Product_Analyze

This project focuses on analyzing a synthetic dataset of sustainable products. The primary objective is to experiment with various machine learning models on the dataset while strictly adhering to the standard data analysis phases to extract meaningful and actionable insights.

**Business Problem:** This involves using machine learning and deep learning models (both broad and deep learning) to predict whether a product is commercially viable (optimum) under all environmental and economic constraints.
