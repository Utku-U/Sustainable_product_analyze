# Sutainable_Product_Analyze

This project focuses on analyzing a synthetic dataset of sustainable products. The primary objective is to experiment with various machine learning models on the dataset while strictly adhering to the standard data analysis phases to extract meaningful and actionable insights.

## Data Analysis Lifecycle
This study is structured around the six core stages of data analysis:

1. **Ask:** Defining the business problem and objectives.
2. **Prepare:** Data generation, collection, and management.
3. **Process:** Data cleaning and ensuring data integrity.
4. **Analyze:** Data exploration, visualization, and model building.
5. **Share:** Communicating findings and interpreting results.
6. **Act:** Applying the insights gained to solve the initial problem.

**Business Problem:** This involves using machine learning and deep learning models (both broad and deep learning) to predict whether a product is commercially viable (optimum) under all environmental and economic constraints.
